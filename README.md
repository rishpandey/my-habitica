# Habitica Dashboard

Single-page Vue 3 app (Vite) to view Habitica dailies and mark them done. Stores only `HABITICA_USER_ID` and `HABITICA_API_KEY` in localStorage.

Quick start

1. Install dependencies

```bash
cd /Users/rishabhpandey/code/misc/my-habitica-ui
yarn
```

2. Run dev server

```bash
yarn dev
```

Notes

-   Enter your Habitica `HABITICA_USER_ID` and `HABITICA_API_KEY` in the inputs at the top. They are saved to `localStorage`.
-   The app uses Pinia for state, Axios for requests, Tailwind for styling, and Day.js for date logic.
